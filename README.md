#### About
The Human Organ-specific Molecule Electronic Repository (Homer) is a comprehensive database covering about 22809 proteins, 52 organs, and 4290 diseases integrated and filtered from organ-specific protein/genes and disease databases like dbEST[1], TiSGeD[2], HPA[3], CTD[5], and Disease Ontology[6]. It is the first comprehensive database that can be used to analyze, identify, and characterize organ-specific biomarkers in association with disease-organ and disease-protein relationship. The database has a web user interface that allows users to query organ-specific genes/proteins by gene, protein, organ or disease, to explore the histogram of an organ-specific gene/protein, and to identify disease-related organ-specific genes by browsing the disease online.
